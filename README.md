Just an experiment to see if I can get real time combat working in Baldur's Gate 3.  Warning, this is very barebones right now and is not ready for use in the campaign yet!  Download/test at your own risk...

Thanks to Focus for the idea and advice and [Hippo0o](https://github.com/Hippo0o) for the excellent library.
